### 📋 Copy Content Below This Line

I am initializing the **Execution Phase** for Project **"Claude-Bridge"**.
You are the **Lead Engineer**.

**Context**:
We are building a **Chrome Extension** that connects the `claude.ai` Web UI to the user's browser, allowing Claude to read the current tab's content. This is a "Trend Jacking" project based on the popularity of "Claude Tooling" (Cowork, 1Code) on Product Hunt today.

**Tech Stack**:
- **Framework**: Plasmo (React + TypeScript)
- **Manifest**: V3
- **Permissions**: `activeTab`, `scripting`

**Implementation Plan**:

1.  **Phase 1: Project Initialization**
    - Initialize Plasmo application.
    - Configure `manifest.json`.

2.  **Phase 2: Core Logic**
    - **Content Script**: Inject a "Bridge" button into the DOM of `claude.ai` (Target: `.ProseMirror` input area).
    - **Background Script**: Listen for button click -> Capture active tab title & URL -> Capture active tab text (using Readability or simple text extraction).
    - **Injection**: Paste the captured text into Claude's input box automatically.

**Immediate Task**:
Please **initialize the Plasmo project** in the current directory and set up the basic file structure.

### 🧠 Strategic FAQ (User Context)

**1. Prerequisites?**
- **NO "Claude Code" needed**: This extension works directly on the free/paid `claude.ai` website. It gives the website "eyes" to see other tabs.

**2. Monetization Strategy (How to make money)?**
- **Primary**: **Traffic Arbitrage**. Use this free tool to capture email leads ("Get my Advanced Claude Prompts PDF") or drive traffic to a paid newsletter.
- **Secondary**: **Donations**. Add a "Buy me a Coffee" button in the popup.
- **Micro-Exit**: Build it to 1,000 users, then sell the extension on MicroAcquire.

**2.1. "I don't have a foreign bank account?" (No Problem)**
- **Crypto & Web3**: Use **Solana/USDT** for donations. It's permissionless and global. We can add a simple "Donate SOL" address.
- **Asset Value**: A free extension with 5,000 users is an ASSET. You don't need to charge the users directly. You can sell the *whole extension* later (platforms like Acquire.com can often facilitate transfers via Escrow/Crypto).
- **Traffic Redirection**: Use the global traffic to direct users to a platform you *can* monetize (e.g., a newsletter on a crypto-friendly platform, or even back to domestic consulting services).

**2.2. "I strictly have NO international payment methods (No Crypto/Bank)?"**
- **Strategy Shift: Reputation Capital**. Forget about immediate cash. Build this to accumulate **GitHub Stars** and **User Numbers**.
- **Domestic Conversion**: Use the success of this global project ("I built a trend-jacking tool with 5k users") to sell **High-Ticket Technical Consulting** or **Job Offers** in your local market. A successful open-source project is the best resume credential.
- **Wait**: Hold the active user base. Payment methods change; your asset (users) will retain value until you find a channel (e.g., finding a partner with an overseas entity later).

**3. Deployment?**
- **Chrome Web Store**: Requires $5 one-time developer fee.
- **Process**: `pnpm build` -> Upload Zip -> Fill metadata -> Wait for review (24-48h).

### 🚀 PERSONALIZED STRATEGY: Xiaohongshu (XHS) Launch
**Your Advantage**: Account "秋秋" (985 EE Student + AI Theme) is the PERFECT launchpad.
**The Narrative**: "My AI Evolution" (我的AI进化论).
**Post 1 Idea**: "文科生也能写代码？不，我是985理科生，但我用 AI 在 1 小时内做了一个火爆外网的 Chrome 插件。"
**Post 2 Idea**: "打破信息差：Claude 网页版无法联网？我给它装了一双眼睛 (附下载)。"
**Why this works**: You are selling the **"AI Super Individual"** persona. The extension is the *proof* of your power. Drive traffic to your profile -> Consultations/Courses.
